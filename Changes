Revision history for Perl extension Alien::IE7.

0.9.2   Tue Oct  2 11:44 PDT 2007
    - added POD coverage tests
    - rewritten install routine
    - fixed build dependency issue on Archive::Zip; its a -build- requirement,
      not a -configuration- requirement
    - added "passthrough" Makefile.PL; we -NEED- to have Module::Build
      installed, auto-generated compatibility Makefile.PLs are insufficient

0.9.1   Sun Sep 30 13:24 PDT 2007
    - added POD docs to Alien::IE7
    - added "--quiet" command line argument to "ie7-install"
    - changed versioning to "${IE7_version}.${alien_release}", so that releases
      could be issued out of sync with upstream IE7.

0.9     Wed Jul 25 12:17 PDT 2007
    - First public version.  Installs IE7 0.9
